## Business Use Case

In numerous industries, paper forms remain a common method for data collection, often resulting in the tedious and error-prone task of manually transcribing handwritten digits. This project tackles these inefficiencies by developing an advanced digit recognition model designed to automate the extraction and digital conversion of handwritten numeric data, significantly boosting both accuracy and productivity.

## Project Overview

This project develops a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the digits dataset from Scikit-Learn in Python. The aim is to create a model that can accurately identify handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
