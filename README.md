## Business Use Case

In numerous industries, paper forms remain a common method for data collection, often resulting in the tedious and error-prone task of manually transcribing handwritten digits. This project tackles these inefficiencies by developing an advanced digit recognition model designed to automate the extraction and digital conversion of handwritten numeric data, significantly boosting both accuracy and productivity.

## Project Overview

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the digits dataset from the Scikit-Learn library in Python. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict handwritten digits (0-9).
