## Project Overview

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the digits dataset from the Scikit-Learn library. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict handwritten digits (0-9) from images.

## Business Use Case

### Automated Form Processing
In many industries, paper forms are still widely used for data collection. Manually transcribing handwritten digits from these forms into digital systems is time-consuming and prone to errors. By integrating a digit recognition model like the one developed in this project, businesses can automatically extract and digitize handwritten numeric data, improving efficiency and accuracy.

### Check Digit Verification
In banking and financial services, checks are often processed by verifying the handwritten digits against the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line. This model can assist in verifying the accuracy of these digits, reducing the need for manual review and minimizing the risk of processing errors.
